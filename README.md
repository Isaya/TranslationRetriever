# TranslationRetriever
TranslationRetriever is a tool designed to help translating mods for Infinity Engine games (c) Bioware and Beamdog. It scans texts from a mod and searches for them in a reference file for which a translation in the target language is already available, in order to retrieve the translation if a match is found.
